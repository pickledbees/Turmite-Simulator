# Turmite Simulator
This project contains a simple web-based Turing Mite (Turmite) simulator for visualisation of different Turmite rule sets and interactions between different Turmites. Canvas wrapper methods from [P5js]()
were used for driving the simulation and canvas manipulation.

## Running
The simulator runs entirely in the browser with no requirement for any backend support - simply open the [main html file](index.html) from the cloned repository.
The [NodeJS Express server file](index.js) in the project simply serves the main html, as well as the accompanying scripts that run the simulator and is not required for local testing.

## Project Structure
All scripts running the simulator can be found in the ```scripts``` folder.
